# Frequency Domain Filtering(Computer Vision)

## Overview

This repository contains a program designed for the exercise on frequency domain filtering in the field of computer vision. The task involves implementing iGaussian, homomorphic,Butterworth, and ideal low-pass and high-pass filters in the frequency domain (using Fourier Transform), considering the characteristics of their coefficients and positions. Additionally, the program compares these frequency domain filters with spatial domain filters.

## Implementation

### 1. Ideal, Gaussian, and Butterworth Filters

The program is structured to design and apply ideal, Gaussian, and Butterworth high-pass filters in the frequency domain. It leverages the Fourier Transform to analyze coefficients and positions, ensuring an optimal design for each filter type.

### 2. Homomorphic Filtering

In addition to the specified filters, the program implements a homomorphic filter. The homomorphic filter is applied to the image of "The Photographer" to enhance its visual quality.
